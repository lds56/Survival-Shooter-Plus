# Unity game demo: Survival Shooter Plus

## Objective

The purpose of the [original project](https://github.com/Wizcorp/unitydemo-SurvivalShooter) is to give Unity developers and designers a place to show off their skills, by adding new features
or fixing issues.

The process is entirely public; this allows contributors to keep some
ownership on their contributions. This is a great way to build your online
presence.

It is open-source, collaborative, and allows great minds to truly show their true potential.

## Disclaimer
