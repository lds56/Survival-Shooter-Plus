# Unity game demo: Survival Shooter Plus

## Objective

The purpose of the original project is to give Unity developers and designers
a place to show off their skills, by adding new features
or fixing issues.

The process is entirely public; this allows contributors to keep some
ownership on their contributions. This is a great way to build your online
presence.

Our approach is open-source, collaborative, and allows great minds to truly show their true potential.
